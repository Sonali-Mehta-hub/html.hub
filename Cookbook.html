        <h2>Recipe 2: Grilled Salmon</h2>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRnpztWuW0dXmyfCfpDCvLmFiwiXhLUG42VJQ&s" alt="Grilled Salmon" height="300px" width="350px" align="right">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Tender salmon fillets seasoned and grilled to juicy perfection.</p>
        <p><b>Why should we eat this?</b> Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are great for heart health and brain function.</p>
        
        <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            Salmon Fillets: Fresh or thawed if frozen<br>
            Oil: For brushing the salmon<br>
            Salt and Pepper: To season<br>
            Lemon Wedges: For serving (optional)<br>
           <h3>Process:</h3>To prepare grilled salmon, start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat (about 400-450°F or 200-230°C). Pat dry the salmon fillets with paper towels. Brush both sides of the fillets with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.

           Place the salmon fillets directly on the grill, skin-side down if they have skin. Grill for approximately 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Avoid flipping the salmon more than once to prevent it from breaking apart. The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and has grill marks on both sides.
           
           Once grilled, remove the salmon from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Optionally, serve with lemon wedges for a refreshing touch.
           
           Adjust cooking time based on the thickness of your salmon fillets and ensure your grill is properly preheated for optimal results. You can also enhance the flavor by adding herbs or spices to the olive oil before brushing onto the fillets.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> A creamy and decadent dessert made with avocado and dark chocolate.</p>
